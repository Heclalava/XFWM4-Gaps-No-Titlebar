# XFWM4-Gaps-No-Titlebar
This is a GTK+ window manager theme for XFCE based on this theme: https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections/tree/master/Xfwm-Gaps/xfwm4
The theme creates a gap between windows when snapped against the screen edge or other windows. I removed the window titlebar and added a slight grey border to better delineate the windows, especially when using dark themes. 

Download the compressed theme, extract and put the theme folder in ~/.themes to have the XFCE window manager recognise the theme style.
